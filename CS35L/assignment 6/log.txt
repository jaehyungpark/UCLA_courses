For this lab, I partnered with someone sitting next to me.
Unfortunately, I didn't get his name, but just his IP addreess.
I'll just name him as johndoe and his id.

Using Ubuntu CD setup, reboot the computer, go to BIOS and boot up from CD/DVD.

1. Install openssh server (setting up the server side first)
$dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
$sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2. The following is the server side setup (I first performed as a server)
Generated public and private key:
$ssh-keygen
Used the default directory, created in '/home/ubuntu/ssh'
Used Passphrase: assignment6 (this is just a test)

Created an account for the lab partner to access the server:
$sudo useradd -d /home/hw6/ - m johndoe
$sudo passwd johndoe

Enter new UNIX password: homework6 (also, this is just a test)

Then created ssh directory:
$cd /home/johndoe
$sudo mkdir .ssh

Changed the ownership and permission of ssh directory:
$sudo chown -R johndoe .ssh
$sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then used emacs to disable password-based authentication:
$emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
In line 32, change the PasswordAuthentication from yes to no
(emacs) C-x C-s

3. The following is the client side setup
Install openssh client first:
$sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Generate public and private key:
$ssh-keygen

Copy my public key to the server for authentication:
$ssh-copy-id -i jaepark@10.97.85.189

Add private key to the authentication agent:
$ssh-add

Use the following command to connect SSH to my partner's server
$ssh jaepark@10.97.85.189
or use X11 session forwarding
$ssh -X jaepark@10.97.85.189

After this step, I(client) was able to access to the server side directory.
Made some tests to make sure it worked.
$firefox
$gedit
$touch test.txt

All of this worked fine and I was able to see the file using X11 session
forwarding.
