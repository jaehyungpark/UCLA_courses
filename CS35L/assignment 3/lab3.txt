0. use wget to download the coreutils-7.6 file
   wget ftp:://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

1. unzip the file using tar
   tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. create a directory named coreutilsInstall
   mkdir coreutilsInstall

3. use cd to go to coreutils directory and read INSTALL file
   cd ~/CS35L/week3/coreutils-7.6
   # read README
   emacs README
   # run and install coreutils in coreutilsInstall directory
   ./configure --prefix="/u/ee/ugrad/jaehyung/CS35L/week3/coreutilsInstall"
   # run make
   make
   # run make install
   make install

4. This step, I tried to display the buggy version of dates using SEASnet
   # used below command
   cd src
   ./ls -l
   # by doing this, it shows the wrong date format
   for example, 2009-09-01 like this format
   # the correct version will be using ls -l

5. I used Brady's patch to make changes
   # created a file named patch_file and used Brady's patch to this file
   touch patch_file

   # when using Brady's patch, the patch file starts from 
   # --- a/src/ls.c
   # +++ b/src/ls.c
   # and ends at /* comment */
   # this is just a log to make sure I don't forget using it later

6. After copying, I ran the command
   patch -p1 <patch_file

   # one thing, in the TA's lecture notes, he mentioned using -p2 not -p1
   # when I tried using -p2 to apply the patch, I get an error message
   # saying wrong -p or --strip option. (just saying)

7. run command make

8. After applying patch, I ran below command to see the correct version
   ./ls -l
   # now it gives me the correct date format
   # for instance, I get Sep 1  2009
