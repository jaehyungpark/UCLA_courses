Looking at gitk windows, there are four section.
The gitk emacs windows shows professor Eggert's GNU emacs git repository's
master branch on SEASnet.

0. Upper left corner: This subwindow gives the tree of all the
commit messages and branching of the repository.

1. Upper right corner: The one in the middle shows the list of all
contributer's (or committer) name and email address.

The one in the right shows the date and time when the commit was made.

2. Lower left corner: This subwindow shows parent, child of the commit, and 
lists the changes made in the selected commit in a diff format.

3. Lower right corner: This subwindow shows files that's been changed.
