1. Maintain a file hw4.txt
$ touch hw4.txt

2. Check out version 3.0 of diffutils from repository into a new branch
named "quote"
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. Install the change into new branch by running patch command
$ patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. Read and learn of add-change-log-entry-other-window emacs function C-x 4 a

5. Use emacs function to compose an appropriate ChangeLog entry for patch
Opened each .c file and used C-x 4 and checked ChangLog
$ emacs ChangeLog
: C-x 4 a

6. Commit changes to new branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "ChangeLog"

7. Used the "git format-patch" to generate a file formatted-patch.txt
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout >formatted-patch.txt

8. My partner is David Chambers and got his patch file, I applied it
to the new branch using the following command
$ git am <formatted-patch.txt

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

9. Verify the ChangeLog entry
$ make distdir

I inspected the ChangeLog file using the command and got bunch of messages.
Got a meesage saying *** No rule to make target `ChangeLog-2008', needed by
`distdir'. Stop.
Used emacs to open ChangeLog and showed logs of 6 .c files that were modified
before. My partner sent me two files and I used the earlier one to do the
process. While I was done applying the patch, he sent me another one and 
tried to reapply it, but somehow I think it got all mixed up.
At this point, I'm really not sure if the patch worked or not.

10. Lastly, install XQuartz and Xming and enter
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs directory and used gitk command to take the screenshot.
$ ssh -X jaehyung@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk

When I typed in gitk, I got an error message saying "-bash: gitk: command not 
found". While going over some piazza posts, I found another way.

$ ssh -X jaehyung@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
$ cd emacs
$ gitk

Still, I got the same error msg. Now I figured out how.
Use lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu instead lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu.
Set the port to 22 and enable X11 forwarding in PuTYY.
After logining in, set the PATH and then type in to the directory.
$ ssh jaehyung@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu #loging first
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
$ ssh -X jaehyung@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk
