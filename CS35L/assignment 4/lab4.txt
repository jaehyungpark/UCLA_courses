0. Since git is preinstalled in seasnet, I enabled the PATH
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

1. Cloned Savannah gnu repository via git clone in git folder
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

2. Generated both git-log.txt and git-tags.txt using git log and git tag
$ git log >git-log.txt
$ git tag >git-tags.txt

3. Open git-log.txt using emacs to find the commit entitled 
"maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this`"
: M-s w "maint: quote

4. Found commit number: 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f and 
generated a patch for that, putting into file quote-patch.txt
$  git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout 
>quote-patch.txt

5. Checked out version 3.0 of diffutils
$ git checkout v3.0

6. Used patch command to apply quote-patch.txt.
$ patch -p1 <quote-patch.txt
In case where I wasn't able to figure out what file to patch, I skipped past
those returning.

7. Used git status to get an overview: the output shows files that changes 
not staged for commit and no changes added to commit
$ git status

8. Learn how to use vc-diff and vc-revert.  I checked other than .c files 
to revert changes, files such as THANKS, TODO, or README, etc.
I used emacs to open them with the following command to revert changes.
: C-x v = C-x v u

After this, checked modified .c files using vc-diff buffer and reverted
changes.
: C-x v = C-u C-c C-a

Also used diff-goto-source (C-c C-c) to goto the source code and find hunks.

9. Running git status again, I got the following message for modified files;
#     modified: src/cmp.c
#     modified: src/diff.c
#     modified: src/diff3.c
#     modified: src/dir.c
#     modified: src/sdiff.c
#     modified: src/util.c

10. Used emacs to examine the files from src/*c.rej and copied rejected
patches into the corresponding .c files.

11. Removed all untracked files (that git status warns me) using below command
$ git clean -f

12. Used git diff into quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ git diff >quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. Building the resulting modified version of diffutils, used commands
below after running both bootstrap and configure
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

14. After this procedure, I verified diffutils using below commands
$ diff . -
For this command, I get a message as below
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

$ diff --help
For this command, I get a message as below
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE.. DIR'.
If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILE(s).
If a FILE is '-', read standard input.
Exist status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

15. I did a sanity check and crerated a directory named diffutils-3.0-patch
and copied all the files from diffutils-3.0
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch

16. Used the original diffutils-3.0 repository and git cloned it into
diffutils-3.0 directory
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git diffutils-3.0

17. Ran the below command to run the implementation of diff
$ diffutil-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch 
>quote-3.0-test.txt 

18. Lastly, I used diff to compare the contents of quote-3.0-text.txt and
quote-3.0-patch.txt.
$ diff quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-test.txt

I see differences in ` and '.
