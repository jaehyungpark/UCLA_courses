CS 111 Lab1b

For lab 1b, it builds from the previous lab1a simpleton shell code and takes much more flag options to
parse through. This time, the code takes pipe and various subcommand options.

One thing to add, I was thinking rather I should add extra lines of code just in case the table index
reaches to it's buffer limit (TABLE_SIZE) and use realloc to increase the size, but the code itself
ran through the testing script without any issues so I left it with 1000 entries. (this can be adjustable)

One other thing to add is that for some cases, actually checks the invalid message using fprintf with
stderr and the signum number in the message. I spend hours to solve this issue while I failed one of the
test cases countless times.

For the Make file,
default lets make to build the simpsh program (just as lab1a)
To proceed the following commands, make should be executed first to create needed files.
make clean removes all unnecessary and temporary files and object files and keeps the original files.
These files include README, Makefile, test.sh, and simpsh.c.
make check tests the simpsh program on some test cases by running test.sh.
make dist makes a software distribution and produces a tar.gz file that includes all the necessary files.
