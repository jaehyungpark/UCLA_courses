For lab 1a, the simpleton shell, or simph takes arguments of rdonly, wronly, command, and verbose options.
The program will accept arguments with multiple options, such as --rdonly --wronly --wronly --command or
--verbose --rdonly --wronly --wronly --command and produce the commands that were used after the verbose
option.

One thing to add, running the test cases given by the TA on piazza, the program passes 8 cases, but
fails test case 6, writing over a none existing file. I spent a whole day to solve this problem, but
couldn't find the solution to solve this issue. Since test case 6 only involves the wronly option, I am
assmuning the switch statement in "wronly" is causing a bug, but not really sure how to solve it.

For the make file,
default lets make to build the simpsh program.
To proceed the following commands, make should be executed first to create needed files.
make clean removes all unnecessary and temporary files and object files and keeps the original files.
These files include README, Makefile, test.sh, and simpsh.c.
make check tests the simpsh program on some test cases by running test.sh.
make dist makes a software distribution and produces a tar.gz file that includes all the necessary files.
