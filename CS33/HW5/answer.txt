A. H2, L2, U2, H1, L1, S2, U1, S1, T1, T2
This path is unsafe

B. H2, H1, L1, U1, S1, L2, T1, U2, S2, T2
This path is safe

C. H1, L1, H2, L2, U2, S2, U1, S1, T1, T2
This path is unsafe

Problem 2) 12.24

Looking at the functions in 10.4, all of the RIO unbuffered input and output packages
pass a pointer into the functions that these functions are implicitly reentrant.
Pointers such as void *usrbuf and rio_t *rp are passed in as a void pointer.
However, we can look into two different situations.
One is that the caller doesn't pass the address of the shared data and the functions
are implicitly reentrant.
Second is that the caller does pass the address of the shared data and the functions
are non-reentrant.
Looking at the figure in 10.5 shows that the caller doesn't pass any shared data and 
we can observe that the functions are non-reentrant.
Thus, functions are implicitly reentrant, but depending how it's being used, it also
can be non-reentrant.
