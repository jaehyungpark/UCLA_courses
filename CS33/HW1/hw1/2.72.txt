// Problem 2.72

A. Since the sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t, which is
   an unsigned integer, the arithmetic inside the if statement follows
   the unsigned rule.
   In other words, when maxbytes - sizeof(val) is bigger or equal than 0,
   the arithmetic works fine. On the other hand, when the value is smaller
   than 0, because of the unsigned integer, the difference is always
   positive (>=0), resulting the if statement to be always true.
   
B. To rewrite the conditional test to make it work properly, we can 
   change as below: (just to make sure maxbytes is bigger or equal than 0)

   if (maxbytes >= 0 && maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
