Problem 3.60
A) values of x is initially stored in $rdi and then moved to %r8.
   values of n is initially stored in %esi and then moved to %ecx.
   values of result is stored in %rax
   values of mask is stored in %rdx

B) Initial values of result is 0
   Initial values of mask is 1

C) mask != 0; mask << (n & 0xFF);

D) mask = mask << (n & 0xFF);
   // given asm snippet salq  %cl, %rdx
   this shows that mask is left shifted by cl, which is
   the lower 8 bits of n.

E) result |= (x & mask); 

F) the missing parts of the C code is in loop.c
